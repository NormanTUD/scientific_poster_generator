write js code for a page on which you have a grid of boxes with red labels and text inside of them, and when you click
them, you can edit markdown and latex code (use mathjax for render), and when you click outside of the textarea there,
it will be rendered, but the original text will be saved in a global array, so that clicking the text allows me to edit
markdown and latex again. full html please, with responsive boxes and an "add another box" button




write me a js/html page where have a button "add new box", which, when clicked, adds a new box in a responsive grid
filling the screen as best as possible. inside each box, there should be a default text. when you click this text, it
will become an editable textarea, when losing focus from that textarea, it should be converted first from markdown to
html and then $$ $$ should be converted to LaTeX. when you drag images in it, it should upload via "upload.php" (which i
already have) and insert the filename to the markdown document.
when you click on any of those elements after they have been edited, they should be editable in markdown/js again, and
when you click somewhere else, they should be rendered.




write me a webpage with jquery and mathjax that has an "add box" button that adds a box to the page. the box should
contain html code that can be edited by clicking on it. when clicking on it, it should be converted into markdown in a
simple textarea. when you blur this textarea, it should convert the markdown to html, and afterwards convert strings
like $$ LaTeX $$ to LaTeX code with mathjax. the boxes should be listed on a responsive grid on the site. editing boxes
takes you back to the last time you edited it.

after editing and blurring and then editing again, show the last edited version of the markdown code. thus, save it for
every element in a global array before rendering as html/mathjax
